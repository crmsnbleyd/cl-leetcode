* What is this repository?
This repository is intended to be a collection of Common Lisp programs that solve programming problems from [[https://leetcode.com][LeetCode]], a platform with many algorithmic and data structure related problems for developers to solve in order to hone their coding and technical interview skills.

At the time of initialisation <2022-09-27 Tue>, the original author has little to no experience with using Common Lisp, and is using the repository as a way to document new learnings.
