* 1. Two Sum
A fairly simple optimised solution (algorithmically, at least. Not sure if idiomatic CL) that uses hash-table.
Checks if the target is the double of the current number and only returns if another instance of the number exists in the input list.

	     do (when (gethash (- target k) hash)
		  (unless (and (= target (* k 2)) (not (cdr (gethash k hash))))
		  (return-from two-sum (car (gethash (- target k) hash))))))))
